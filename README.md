# RNA_Velocity- Checkout the main/original Tutorial at the Github page ->> theislab/scvelo <<-
This is a tutorial code for RNA velocity which I just followed and ran to get a feel of the package and protocol as a precusor to learning more and applying it in a practical sense.
The introduction of RNA velocity by La Manno et al. (Nature, 2018) has enabled the recovery of directed dynamic information by leveraging the fact that newly transcribed, unspliced pre-mRNAs and mature, spliced mRNAs can be distinguished in common single-cell RNA-seq protocols, the former detectable by the presence of introns. This concept of measuring not only gene activity, but also their changes in individual cells (RNA velocity), has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation. The originally proposed framework obtains velocities as the deviation of the observed ratio of spliced and unspliced mRNA from an inferred steady state. Errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated.
